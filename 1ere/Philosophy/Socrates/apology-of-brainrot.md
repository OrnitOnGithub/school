# Questions Apology of Socrates or smth

What Socrates is accused of, and his defense:

- Corrupting the youth
    1. Living among corrupted people is harmful
    2. Nobody intentionally does something harmful to themselves
    - Conclusion: nobody intentionally hurts people they live with.
    - SO:
        - Either he did it **INTENTIONALLY**
            - But then he did something that might harm himself because he'd've harmed himself
        - Or he did it **UNINTENTIONALLY**
            - In which case he cannot be sentenced
- Rejecting the greek Gods
    - He gets Meletus to admit:
    1. Whoever believes in the existence of divine things also believes in the existence of God.
    2. That he believes in divine things (that was Meletus' accusation)
    - Conclusion: Socratium believes in the existence of Gods.

THere are three parts

1. Socrates' defense (hes not guilty btw)
2. Socrates' proposal for his own punishment
3. Final statement (after being sentences to death)

Socrates says there are "rumors" and "slanders" that got him in trouble. These slanderers are:
- Presocratics
- Sophists

Appolo The Oracle of Delphi told some Socrates' friend that Socrates is the wisest of them all.

To test that, Socrates visits
- Political experts
    - Who however only think themselves wise but actually braindead.
- Poets
    - They have natural talent but know jack.
- Craftsmen
    - Craftsmen are wise in their domain, but think they are wise overall, which they are not. This is called **Ultracrepidarianism**.

Socrates concludes the reason he is the wisest is not because he knows everything, but because he knows that he does not know much.

Why do you do what you do despite risks?
- One should always fulfil their duty.
- Death is not to be feared
    - Option A : abandon duty : BAD
    - Option B : die : ...maybe?
    - Conclusion: A is worst, death is best.
- Socrates wants to encourage people to care about htier souls
- He says he is the gadfly to Athens' horse
    - When needed, he wakes the Athenians up by stinging them.
- He says that he defends Athenians and not himself
    - It is worse to commit injustice than to suffer it, so he is sparing the Athenians from comitting injustice (This excuse is utter, stratospherical, gargantuan, astronomical bullshit)

Socrates is not involved in the political life of Athens because:
- There is a divine voice in his head (his daimon) telling him not to.
    - (I have such a divine voice in my head but they want me to believe it's "schizophrenia")
- He wouldn't survive long trying to act justly in Athen's political life (IMO: minor contradiction here, kys Socrates)

im too tired to continue this
