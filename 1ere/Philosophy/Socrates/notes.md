## Socrates accusation of corrupting the youth

His arguments:

- He asks wether he's accused of corrupting the youth intentionally or unintentionally
  - If (unintentional)
    - He wants to be lectured, and doesn't deserve death
  - Else
    - By hurting others he hurts society, and as a member he hurts himself as well.

## Socratic dialogue

- Socrates never wrote or taught anything
- Two main types:
  - Those in which his interlocutors thik they know better than others (often politicians, sophists...)
  - Those in which they admit their ignorance and are eager to discuss the topic and learn something
- In the first case, Socrates will display socratic irony:
  - Act dumb and ask for explanations, then use those explanations against them
- In most dialogue, Socrates looks for a definition of something.
  - What is common to all instances of X and what makes them X?
  - Necessary condition:
    - Being a rectangle is necessary for being a square
      - you cannot be a square without being a triangle
  - Sufficient condition
    - If you have a square, you have a rectangle
      - being a square is a necessay condition to be a rectangle

### Cephalus
- Socrates asks how he got rich
- The man says the closer you get the death the more you reflect about what happens after.
- Why is it good to be rich:
  - Since he was rich he did not need to commit crimes, and could give back to the Gods.
- Socrates asks if that's all justice is? Speak the truth and pay your debts? That's it?
  - What if yo homie gives you his weapon and then he wants it back but he's in a deranged state

### Hippias Major
- Socrates sucks Hippias' dick at first
- Socrates asks for help to become wiser about what is happiness (still trickery)
- Hipias fails to answe properly
