### What made fascism so attractive?
The economic factor
- Fascism aims to take control of the economy, skipping any "natural stabilisation" process that may occur from a free economy. And going straight to state-set priorities.
- Control of the economy could promise security, in terms of food, commodities, etc
- This could allow to create job opportunities, at least in the short term.
Autarchy: Create everything inside the country: everything local, self-sustained. For example, during the great depression, Italy wasn't as affected.

- Propaganda

## Nazism

Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Führer!!!

### Core Ideologies

- Aryan race should have a lot of space to develop themselves (Versailles Diktat) and take over Russia and other regions
- All power to Hitler
- Gestapo == Secret police
- SS == Elite troops
