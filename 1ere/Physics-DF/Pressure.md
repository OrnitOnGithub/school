## Pressure on surfaces
### Pressure vs Force and Surface

```
F = P * A
P = F / A

F = Force       (N)
P = Pressure    (Pa, N/m^2)
A = Area        (m^2)
```

## Pressure in fluids
### Pressure of fluids in relation to height of the container

The following equation always remains the same. The size or shape of the container does not matter, all that matters is its height.
```
P = ρ * g * h

ρ = Density (of fluid)  (g/L or kg/m^3)
g = gravity             (9.81)
h = height              (m)
```

### Hydraulics

You have two pistons, connected by a fluid.
One piston has a large surface area, the other a small one.
```
P1 = F1 / A1
```
```
P2 = F2 / A2
```
and
```
P1 = P2
```
so
```
F1 / A1 = F2 / A2
```
This means if A1 is bigger than A2, F1 will have to be bigger, and F2 smaller.

So if you exert a force F2 on a small surface A2, The force F1 on the surface A1 will be stronger.

## Archimede's Principle

```
|-_-_-_-|
|   __  |   Object inside a fluid.
|  |//| |   The object displaces a certain
|  |//| |   volume of the fluid, equal to 
|       |   the object's size.
\_______/
```
Formula:
```
Af = ρf * Vd * g

Af = Archimede's Force          (N)
ρf = Density of the fluid       (Kg/m^3)
Vd = Displaced volume by object (m^3)
g  = gravitational constant     (9.81)
```
When submerged into a fluid, an object will _displace_ that fluid. The fluid, trying to reclaim the space, will push the object up.

The denser the fluid, the stronger the force.

The bigger the object, the stronger the force.
