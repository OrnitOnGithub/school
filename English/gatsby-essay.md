# Random shit

## American Dream decline

1920s in US -> decayed moral value, evidenced by greed, cynicism, empty pursuit of pleasure -> shown in TGG by G's parties every saturday night -> corruption of the american dream -> money and pleasure > more noble goals

Money is wasted on destructive toys, such as powerful cars and huge buffet tables.

## Hollowness of the upper class

TGG studies the sociology of wealth.

Newly rich are vulgar, lavish, lakcing in social graces and taste. Shown by G. -> monstrously ornate mansion, pink suit, rolls royce, cannot tell insincerity of the Sloane's invitation.

The old aristocracy -> Careless bullies, use money's ability to never worry about hurting others. Shown by the Buchanans at the end of the novel, who simply move far away rather than attend Gatsby's funeral.

## Critique of the American Dream

Every character somewhat draws from this ideal, but make it seem unattainable. G. spends his live believing he can make enough mmoney and transcent his lower-class birth and be equal to Daisy and Tom. Gatsby's failure for instance paints the American Dream as unattainable.

## Love and Marriage

2 Marriages -> convenience

Jordan and Nick -> Not love, rather a "tender curiosity" -> closest thing to love.

## The green light and the green colour

Gatsby's hopes and dreams.

## Valley of ashes

A dumping of insustrial ashes. Represents the moral decay that results from unhibited pursuit of wealth. Also symbolises the plight of the poor. George wilson who lives among the dirty ashes is devoid of vitality.

## Eyes of T.J. Eckleburg

Has no explicit meaning throughout the novel, only given by characters. Could represent God's eyes staring down and judging the American society as a moral wastleand. The connection between the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg and God exists only in George Wilsonâ€™s grief-stricken mind.

## Deceitful symbols

The car - Falsely presented as a symbol of progress and safe travel. Fitzgerald remains sceptic, and depicts it as a dangerous toy. In chapter 7 Myrtle is the victim of a car accident. Tom also is a dangerous driver and also gets in a car accident. It symbolizes the American dream. Is it truly so wholesome?
