There is a recipe written in DNA

Protein synthesis occurs everywhere in the cell except from nucleus, however the data is inside the nucleus (DNA). RNA moves around and transfers information.

Pores are holes in the nucleus. They are too small for DNa to pass through, but RNA can pass through

RNA goes to fetch the recipe inside the nucleus

RNA is the tool from which the right amino acid will be brought to the protein under construction

Transcrption: read DNA and copy to RNA
translation: assemble amino acids in right order using RNA (using genetic code, 64 options)
It needs 3 nucleotides that are read 3x3, they are called "codons" or "triplets".

It is imperative the sequence is read correctly, (hence STOP thingies), because a misshaped protein is a nonfuncitonal 

To copy RNA:
- Helicase unzips
- Topoisomerase stabilises protein
- RNA Polymerase does its thing

Not everything is copied, only one gene

RNA Polymerase connects a U in front of an A, for example, etc

Strand that is copied is called template. The actual template is called the leading strand, which is MISLEADING.

Stabilising structure added to the RNA molecule (cap)

DNA -> RNA = transcription

Starting moment of gene -> promoter ("tata box") (what?)

RNA gets spliced, Introns get removed -> Process called "mature pre-messenger rna into messenger rna"

UGA UAA UAG -> Stop signals codons

- Universal for all living beings, reflects common ancestry
- Based on triplet codons
- Redundancy, mutliple codons for amino acids
- For each codon, only 1 AA

The RNA strand can bond to itself. It can create hydrogen bonds with itself.

## Exercise: Bacteria resistance to antibiotics

Check the sheet of paper

highest Use of antibiotics -> highest Rate of antibiotic resistance

I know that antibiotics will exert a selection

I deduce that ww

THere is a mutation in the form of a substitution in the genes sensitive and resistant

An enzyme is a protein, by changing the gene you change the shape of a protein and therefore change its function

I observe on document 2b that the bacterium which is sensitive to the antibiotic has a bacterical enzyme with an active site that can be occupied by the antibiotic whereas the bacterium which is resistant, the antibiotic cannnot bindf to the active site of the bacterial enzyme, the shape does not fit, thus preventing the antibiotic from having an effect.

I know that punctual mutation in gene can have reprecussions on a protein because of gthe DNA of the gene will be transcribed in to RNA and then the mRNA will be translated into a protin

I deduce that the punctual mutation in the DNA on nucleotide 23 in the sequence of the gene of the baceria modifies the protein that is synthesized from it. (different amino acid)

A different protein has a different shape, and that hinders the antiviotic from blocking the active site of the PLP enty√®e: the amtibiotic loses its inhibitory functio
