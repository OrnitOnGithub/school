# Static

```
E = Fe / q

F = k(q * Q) / r^2

E = k Q / r^2

E = mg / q

E = Fe * q


E = mg / Q
Q = charge élémentaire

Fe = EQ
```

Coulomb's Law:

$F = \frac{k * q1 * q2}{r²}$

Electric Field Strength:

$E = \frac{Fe}{Q}$

$F = Eq$

Combine both:

$E = k\frac{q}{r²}$

# Kinetic

Current **I** in **Amperes**

Potential difference between two points = Voltage **V** in **Volts**

Resistance **R** in $\Omega$ (**ohms**)

Resistivity $\rho$ in $\Omega / m$

$R = \rho * \frac{L}{S}$

Energy E in Joules

Power P in Watts. P = E/t

$P = V * I$

$V = R * I$

## Law of knots

Say there are three charges arriving at a node, $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$, as well as two charges leaving the note $I_4$ and $I_5$. Then,

$I_1 + I_2 + I_3 = I_4 + I_5$

In other words

$\Sigma i_{entering} = \Sigma i_{exiting}$

## Resistors

In series:

$$R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + ...$$

In parallel:

$$\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ...$$

$$R_{total} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ...}$$
